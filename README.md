# Models Overview
This project employs several time series forecasting models to predict energy consumption. Below are detailed descriptions of each model used in this project.
## 1. ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)
## Overview: 
ARIMA is a widely used statistical method for time series forecasting. It combines autoregressive and moving average components along with differencing to make the time series stationary.
## Key Features:
1) Effective for univariate time series data.
2) Identifies patterns and relationships based on past values.
3) Parameters: ùëù(AR terms), ùëë(differencing), ùëû(MA terms).
## Usage:
Used as a baseline model to evaluate performance against more complex models.
## 2. SARIMA (Seasonal AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)
## Overview: 
SARIMA extends ARIMA to handle seasonal data. It incorporates seasonal autoregressive and moving average components to better capture seasonality in time series.
## Key Features:
1) Accounts for both non-seasonal and seasonal factors.
2) Parameters: ùëÉ,ùê∑,ùëÑ,ùëÜ represent seasonal AR terms, differencing, MA terms, and the seasonality length.
## Usage:
Utilized for datasets with clear seasonal patterns, enhancing forecast accuracy.
## 3. LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)
## Overview: 
LSTM is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) designed to learn long-term dependencies in sequential data. It is well-suited for time series forecasting due to its ability to capture complex relationships.
## Key Features:
1) Handles large datasets and long sequences.
2) Can learn nonlinear patterns and relationships in data.
3) Employs a gating mechanism to retain relevant information over time.
## Usage:
Applied to capture intricate relationships and dynamics in the energy consumption data.
## 4. Enhanced SARIMA (E_SARIMA)
## Overview: 
The enhanced SARIMA model incorporates advanced techniques to improve forecasting accuracy. This includes optimizing hyperparameters, implementing cross-validation, and integrating external factors such as weather conditions.
## Key Features:
1) Improved parameter tuning for better model fit.
2) Incorporation of additional exogenous variables to enhance prediction accuracy.
3) Continuous model evaluation and updates based on feedback loops.
## Usage:
Used as the primary model for accurate energy consumption forecasts, leveraging its enhanced capabilities to adapt to changing patterns in the data.
